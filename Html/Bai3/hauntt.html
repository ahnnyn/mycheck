                 <h2>The Haunted Maze</h2>
                 <p>
                    Back for another year, every night, the Sunny Acres Corn Maze becomes the Sunny Acres Haunted <br>
                    Maze. This season's maze begins with an encounter with an evil organist (played by the Council <br>
                    Bluff Choir's own Glenn Frye). Explore the maze and find the zombie graveyard, the pumpkin tower, <br>
                    and a haunted house made of corn, not to mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other assorted <br>
                    villainy that inhabit the maze.
                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <p>
                    The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October with a special event on Halloween. <br>
                    Come early in the day to explore the larger Corn Maze, stay for a homemade meal of brats and <br>
                    burgers, soda, and chips, and then participate in the Halloween Festival. Special stations will <br>
                    be set up in the Haunted Maze for trick-or-treaters. A smaller maze is also available that is <br>
                    "scare-friendly" for younger children.
