                <p>
                    Welcome to the home page of our family farm, Sunny Acres, where there's always something <br>
                    happening. With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big AutumnFest and Farm Show. <br>
                    If you haven't visited our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do so before it gets torn down on <br>
                    November 5. This year's maze is bigger and better than ever. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception. Schools and home-schooling parents, <br>
                    take an afternoon with us at our Petting Barn. We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean <br>
                    environment. Kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, and calves while they learn about nature<br>
                    and the farming life. Please call ahead for large school groups. 
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a good fright. Sunny Acres provides<br>
                    that too with another year of the Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends in <br>
                    October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices and great <br>
                    produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
                </p>
